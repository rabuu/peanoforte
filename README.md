# PeanoForte ðŸŽ¹
A toy proof verifier for Peano-arithmetic written in C.

This verifier is built upon the idea of the [Peano axioms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms).

## Build dependencies
The parser is built using [flex](https://github.com/westes/flex) and [GNU bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) which need to be installed.
